# Observer Pattern
Observer is a behavioral design pattern that allows one objects to notify other objects about changes in their state.

The Observer pattern provides a way to subscribe and unsubscribe to and from these events for any object that implements a subscriber interface.

#Usage examples
PHP has several built-in interfaces (SplSubject, SplObserver) that can be used to make your implementations of the Observer pattern compatible with the rest of the PHP code.
